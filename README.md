# Ahmed Mohamed Hussien 👋

Engineering Data Analyst specializing in industrial systems and time-series analytics.
Focus on Python-based analysis of sensor and operational data for anomaly detection,
condition monitoring, and reliability insights.

This repository demonstrates my work as an Engineering Data Analyst applying Python-based time-series analysis to industrial systems. 
The focus is on analyzing sensor and operational data (current, temperature, vibration, load) to detect abnormal behavior using transparent statistical methods.
The project emphasizes engineering interpretation, condition monitoring, and actionable insights rather than black-box models, reflecting real-world industrial and reliability use cases.

Python-based industrial time-series analysis project focused on anomaly detection and condition monitoring with engineering interpretation.
